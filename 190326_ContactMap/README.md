# Contact Map

### The idea of this project was to create a unique concept for a contact page for my online portfolio that would give viewers the ability to keep track of my live position on a map. I used an Overland (https://github.com/aaronpk/Overland-iOS) and an ngrok proxy url (https://ngrok.com/) to send my geodata to a REST API. I then built my website app to access the data.

### Enjoy!
